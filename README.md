# Javascript-challenge

## In this challenge an html page was given and I created the syntax for the UFO dataset provided. Using the forEach function I was able to pull the values from the keys and append it to the table in the html file. 

## After creating the table, I used listeners to be able to click on the button or use Enter to be able to filter out by date. The page refreshes to show the date selected with all required information.

## For level 2, I used the same beginning syntax but added other filters in the filteredData variable. I also had to update the html page to allow for the extra input fields. This will allow to pull any data that has at least one of the desired inputs.
